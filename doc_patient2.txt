00:09 hi
00:09 dr caddy good to see you again good to
00:12 see you
00:13 how are you doing today well first of
00:17 all i'm really glad to be
00:18 here to see you because i've been
00:22 really nervous i fell too much
00:25 oh no and
00:29 i've been getting dizzy and
00:33 i know this when i stand up and if i try
00:35 to spend it too quickly
00:38 then i'm kind of busy and
00:42 it's really getting next to me it's
00:44 beginning to
00:46 really keep me nervous okay i'm so sorry
00:49 to hear that it sounds like something we
00:51 need to work on
00:52 yes we do and i think it's because of
00:55 the latest
00:57 diabetes medicine okay i i saw that
00:60 you've been to see the diabetes doctor
01:02 the endocrinologist and they've added
01:04 another medicine
01:05 yes did the dizziness start around that
01:08 time or was it
01:09 prior it was real
01:12 light before okay the medicine
01:16 but since the medicine is it's
01:19 gotten progressively worse okay
01:22 and um
01:33 i fell and ended up on my left side
01:37 and i had to wake my husband that didn't
01:40 get me
01:41 so that must have been scary yes it was
01:45 and embarrassing too
01:46 yeah well thank goodness that you didn't
01:48 have any serious injury and it sounds
01:50 like this is something we really need to
01:52 focus on
01:53 yes i i knew it would make me feel a lot
01:55 better if i could
01:58 know why i'm getting so dizzy but i'm
02:01 thinking this doesn't happen
02:03 you know i think medicine may have a lot
02:04 to do with it you are on several
02:06 different medications so that's
02:08 something we want
02:09 to really look at yeah that must be
02:12 really hard to keep track of it
02:14 yes because my husband has to put them
02:16 in the pill box
02:19 and i try my best but
02:23 it's it's hard um
02:26 some almost twice a day some once a day
02:30 and it's just been a challenge
02:33 okay and it's beginning to get a little
02:36 bit worse
02:37 so you say it's beginning to get a
02:39 little worse and i have that same
02:41 feeling after
02:42 we've known each other for several years
02:44 now and
02:45 with your different medical conditions
02:47 we see more medicines added on from the
02:50 providers that you see
02:52 i guess i'd like to take a step back
02:54 with you for a minute
02:56 and think with you given
02:59 that some years have passed that you're
03:01 on more medicine that you've had this
03:03 fall
03:04 that we're in a little bit of a
03:05 different situation than we were when we
03:08 first met
03:09 and i think it's really important for
03:13 patients and their providers to think
03:16 together
03:17 about what's really important to the
03:19 patient what what makes their life
03:22 meaningful and independent
03:27 for you it's independent yes okay yeah
03:29 so
03:30 so when we think about this we know
03:32 people generally fall into
03:34 four categories independence is one of
03:36 those
03:37 so so for some individuals it's their
03:40 relationships
03:42 with family friends faith communities
03:46 for some it's what they do that they
03:48 find enjoyable in life
03:50 hobbies perhaps that they very much
03:52 enjoy or being a reader
03:56 for others it's managing their medical
03:58 conditions keeping
03:59 really tight control of their blood
04:01 sugars are
04:02 managing their their blood pressure
04:04 really well and then for another group
04:06 just as you mentioned yourself it's
04:08 really being as independent as they can
04:11 be
04:13 it only thing that i am
04:16 completely independent of is taking my
04:19 shower because i have the grab bars in
04:22 the
04:22 restroom and i also have the shower
04:25 chair
04:27 so in there i
04:30 i feel like my old self okay you know
04:33 and um that's really important to me
04:37 oh my way um so
04:40 um that's one refreshing
04:44 thing that i'm enjoying but uh
04:48 there's so many other things i've had to
04:51 not do because i'm not going to the
04:53 grocery store
04:57 the house
05:01 and also when that doctor gave me
05:05 the diabetes medicine i was supposed to
05:08 check my
05:11 a1c twice a day
05:14 and i haven't been because my husband
05:18 has to
05:19 read it from me and i think he's just
05:23 and his name look what all he can do i
05:26 understand and i know he has some of his
05:28 own health
05:29 issues so hearing you talk about
05:34 independence you know i think it would
05:36 be helpful for you and i to think
05:38 together
05:39 about how we can help you be more
05:42 independent in some areas of course okay
05:45 you know unfortunately there are some
05:46 areas because of your vision like
05:48 driving this
05:49 that's not a realistic goal to get back
05:52 now
05:53 um but it sounds like to me you being
05:56 able
05:57 to move around a bit more independently
06:00 without this fear of falling
06:02 yes is a big goal for you yes okay
06:06 so i agree with you i think your
06:09 medications are really contributing to
06:12 this
06:12 i'm not sure it's just the diabetic
06:15 medication that the doctor
06:16 added recently okay because one thing i
06:19 noticed when i looked at your blood
06:21 pressure from when you came in today
06:22 is when you go from a lying down
06:26 to a setting to a standing position your
06:28 blood pressure
06:29 drops okay okay that says this thing
06:31 called orthostatic hypotension just
06:34 a big fancy name that our blood pressure
06:35 drops when we change positions
06:38 and when you say to me that at home
06:40 you're feeling dizzy when you stand up
06:42 or
06:43 that you were in bed and got up to use
06:44 the restroom and got busy and fell that
06:46 makes me think that's what's going
06:48 on at home okay okay
06:51 so to try to support your goal of being
06:55 independent
06:56 i think we need to number one get rid of
06:59 some of your medicines that could be
07:00 causing this dizziness
07:02 that would happen a lot you know so
07:05 financially it would have
07:06 okay good so so the one i'm going to
07:09 recommend we discontinue today
07:11 is the one called carbide wall that's
07:13 the blood pressure until you take
07:15 twice a day so hopefully that will make
07:18 it easier
07:19 okay um we may be able to get rid of or
07:22 decrease the other two blood pressure
07:24 medicines
07:25 as well it looks like your blood
07:26 pressure has been well controlled
07:28 but let's do one at a time so that we
07:30 know what's
07:32 causing any impacts that we may have
07:35 okay
07:35 now you mentioned and and i know from
07:38 our past discussions
07:40 it's hard for you for example to take
07:42 your blood pressure at home because of
07:44 the
07:44 visual issues right would you be okay
07:47 with me setting up a nurse to come out
07:49 to the house to check your blood
07:51 pressure
07:52 on every time okay so i want to know how
07:56 it's doing as we adjust these
07:57 medicines so okay i'll put that order
08:01 in and what will happen is you'll get a
08:02 phone call and they'll schedule a time
08:04 to come out for the initial visit
08:06 okay okay that sounds good
08:10 i notice you're not using any sort of
08:12 assistive device today no
08:14 walker or cane
08:18 no i i haven't been uh every now and
08:21 then i'll
08:22 use my husband's cane but
08:25 that's very very shallow okay so anyway
08:29 i've been
08:30 holding on to the furniture yeah how's
08:33 the wow
08:34 how that works well the wall doesn't
08:36 help you because you can't
08:38 grab it like the grab bars but the
08:41 furniture
08:42 is more stable how would you feel about
08:46 using a roll leader one of the
08:48 the walkers you see with the hand braids
08:52 one of the big ones well
08:56 they're not overly big but what's with
08:59 the seats
09:07 okay
09:12 well they have really large ones for
09:15 individuals who are a bit bigger but no
09:16 we get to a normal size
09:18 okay let's get in there
09:26 they are and i can tell this isn't
09:28 something
09:29 that you're excited about none of us
09:31 would be excited
09:32 but i think given your goal of being
09:35 more
09:36 independent and in particular being up
09:38 and around the house
09:40 we want to do that as safely as possible
09:43 and this is going to give you more
09:45 stability
09:46 than a cane which just has one arm or
09:49 one leg so to speak
09:51 this is going to give you more stability
09:53 so i think in terms of helping you
09:56 be more independent this is an important
09:58 safety
09:59 tool and it may be
10:03 if by changing your medicine
10:06 this dizziness gets better you may not
10:08 need this forever
10:09 but in the short term while we're
10:11 working through this and helping your
10:13 business i think this will help you to
10:15 be safe
10:19 the other thing that i wonder if you
10:20 might be open to
10:22 is starting some physical therapy at
10:24 home to work on
10:26 balance and strengthening in the legs
10:29 and because they are kind of weak
10:32 well they had wanted me to go to
10:35 physical therapy
10:36 but it was so far from my house to go
10:39 and then my son would have to carry me
10:41 and it was three times a week
10:44 and i just couldn't ask my son to miss
10:47 any more
10:48 along with eight backers you know you
10:50 just
10:52 you know i understand that's a lot of
10:53 travel and i'm sure a lot of time off
10:55 work for him
10:56 but we're setting up the nurse to come
10:58 out to the house so we can go ahead and
10:60 set up the physical therapy through the
11:02 same agency so they can come out
11:04 and work with you
11:07 [Music]
11:10 you think they could help my husband
11:12 also
11:14 they might be able to something you
11:15 should talk to his doctor about
11:18 okay okay they're gonna need separate
11:20 orders for each of you oh okay yeah
11:22 unfortunately we can't do the buddy plan
11:24 but but you know that may be something
11:26 that
11:27 benefits him as well
11:30 now you mentioned that the fall happened
11:33 at night
11:33 and yeah you know i understand needing
11:35 to get up to use the restroom
11:38 would a bedside commode a portable
11:42 oh no i don't know you don't want it
11:44 yeah okay that's a flat no
11:46 no okay so they point you
11:49 oh you can get to do this and okay
11:53 i'll try them so use the as you go to
11:56 the rest right now
11:57 okay do you have night lights so you can
12:00 see when you get up there yes
12:02 i can see okay the light's not
12:05 in the room but it's it's in the highway
12:08 and
12:09 i can see in my business okay so you
12:12 feel that there's adequate lighting yes
12:14 okay yes one other thing that you had
12:17 mentioned and i wanted to go back to
12:19 is that the diabetes doctor the
12:21 endocrinologist had asked you to check
12:23 your blood sugars
12:24 but you haven't been doing that because
12:26 you can't see it and
12:28 it's just too much so i can go ahead and
12:31 ask the bisbee nurse to do that when
12:33 she's there
12:34 no it'll only be a couple times per week
12:37 it won't be as
12:38 frequent as the diabetic doctor has
12:41 requested it
12:42 okay but frankly i think that's enough
12:45 you're not needing insulin and
12:49 right now we're balancing you being as
12:52 independent with things as you can
12:55 not needing to ask your husband perhaps
12:58 too
12:58 more than he can handle right now while
13:01 still controlling your health issues and
13:03 i
13:03 i think that's a reasonable balance for
13:05 that
13:07 that sounds good okay and i'll reach out
13:09 to the diabetic doctor and let her know
13:12 the reason that we're doing that so that
13:14 you won't have to worry about that when
13:16 you see her next
13:17 good yes
13:28 you know you have a lot of specialty
13:30 doctors that you see
13:31 heart doctors yeah eight of them
13:35 and that sounds like that's a burden as
13:37 well it is a burden
13:39 yeah um and then everybody writes a
13:43 prescription
13:46 so prescriptions are high
13:51 so yes i'd like to get rid of several of
13:54 those medications
13:56 because it's been so long and i've been
13:58 on so long i've forgotten
14:00 what each one of that must fool right
14:03 and it sounds like financially
14:07 yeah okay and financially it sounds like
14:09 a strain as well
14:11 okay so i think what we should do is
14:15 look through this list
14:16 i think there are several that we can
14:18 get rid of again i don't want to change
14:20 more than one of the
14:22 the blood pressure pills today because
14:24 those aren't good and safe to change too
14:26 quickly for you
14:27 okay i think we definitely can get rid
14:30 of your fish oil
14:33 no no you want to keep your fish oil yes
14:36 it helps in my brain
14:39 supposed to help me with mobility too so
14:42 there have been some studies that show
14:44 probably the fish oil
14:45 isn't as helpful as we once thought it
14:47 was really yeah do you ever eat fish
14:52 salmon almost a week maybe that's
14:54 perfect
14:55 so if you can eat salmon once a week and
14:57 maybe add fish one additional time
14:59 even like canned tuna doesn't have to be
15:03 expensive fish i think you would get the
15:05 same benefit
15:06 and not have to take the tablets of the
15:08 fish oil
15:10 you say stuff i do
15:15 okay let's try let's see let's try it
15:17 okay
15:18 and how about the multivitamins most of
15:21 us in america we have a good enough diet
15:23 we don't get a lot of benefit from a
15:25 multivitamin tablet
15:28 no i need to multiply them okay
15:32 i need the fish all too and if i
15:35 if i had a choice
15:38 i would take the fish on that lovely
15:40 bite okay that's fine
15:42 it's always up to you i'm good i feel
15:45 better should we try that this
15:47 you'll keep your fish oil yes still try
15:49 to eat your fish though okay
15:51 yes and we'll get rid of the
15:52 multivitamin okay okay
15:55 how are your bowels doing i know you had
15:57 some constipation with the iron
15:59 supplement
15:59 and they added the medicine to help with
16:02 that
16:05 well i go twice a day
16:08 but like i said i don't know which
16:10 medication is doing what
16:13 anymore okay i take so many
16:16 yes that i can't remember
16:19 what spoke with anymore okay so i tell
16:21 you what before you go home today
16:23 when we print out your list of
16:25 medications at the end that we always
16:27 give you
16:28 okay i'm gonna write next to each one
16:31 what they're for oh great so that you
16:33 have a list telling you what you're
16:35 taking it for okay
16:36 great um so i gotta hit my move
16:40 okay good so i would like to think of a
16:44 plan with you and i
16:45 i know it's hard for you to get in
16:47 because of transportation issues so
16:49 typically when we're adjusting blood
16:51 pressure medicines
16:52 we see folks back quite soon within a
16:54 couple weeks or so but i
16:56 it sounds like that would be hard for
16:57 your son since we have the nurse coming
17:00 out to the house would it be okay if i
17:02 gave you a call
17:03 instead of having you come into the
17:05 office and we could chat about how
17:07 you're doing
17:08 yes okay so i'm gonna plan to call you
17:12 in two weeks
17:13 okay to follow up on how the dizziness
17:16 is doing and how you're feeling
17:17 okay i also want to make sure that
17:19 you're using your roll later
17:22 okay i'm going to try that i appreciate
17:25 it i i really think it's going to help
17:27 you to be more
17:28 independent and i'll be following up
17:30 with the nurse
17:32 and the physical therapist so i know how
17:33 the blood pressure is doing with the
17:35 changes we've made
17:37 but if you need anything before if
17:39 you're feeling
17:40 worse if you have concerns about your
17:42 blood pressure you don't hesitate to
17:44 give us a call
17:45 okay so i'm going to go print out that
17:48 list of medicines
17:50 and write out what each is for and then
17:51 i'll be back in to walk you out
17:53 there
17:54 [Music]
17:56 it's our pleasure it's good to see you
17:58 i'll be back in just a couple minutes
17:59 okay
18:00 thank you
18:18 we're not gonna jump back in the middle
18:20 now okay
18:30 [Music]
18:42 well thank you for doing that
19:09 um
19:23 and we're on seven
