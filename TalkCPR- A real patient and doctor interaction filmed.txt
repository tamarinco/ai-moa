00:04 afternoon catch nice to see you uh
00:07 nice to uh catch up again how are you
00:10 i'm good thank you how are you not too
00:12 bad not too but not too bad i'm in my
00:14 office in
00:16 belindra cancer hospital as you as you
00:18 can see
00:19 very nice
00:20 and uh good to see you uh at home as
00:23 well the the new world of of um
00:26 outpatient appointments via via video
00:29 link isn't it indeed yeah
00:32 um
00:33 so good good to contact you and i think
00:35 last time we saw each other uh face to
00:38 face
00:39 um
00:40 and i think the focus was a bit sort of
00:43 your sort of pain management
00:46 um i think i think today the focus was
00:48 going to be i was going to talk a little
00:50 bit about uh you know discussing future
00:53 treatments as such if that is okay with
00:56 you yeah sounds good
00:58 um
00:58 do you mind just for the purpose of the
01:01 consultation do you mind just quickly
01:03 summarizing where things are at at the
01:05 moment that will that be okay yeah no
01:07 that's fine uh so i'm kat um i am
01:12 39 i think about that happen i'm 39 and
01:15 i have stage four breast cancer um i was
01:18 first diagnosed nine years ago
01:20 um and had um a whole lot of treatment
01:23 then
01:23 and then
01:24 four years ago received my secondary
01:27 diagnosis um where the breast cancer has
01:30 since spread to
01:32 other parts of my body like my lungs and
01:34 my bones and i've now been having
01:37 treatment
01:38 um so palliative chemotherapy
01:41 um now for four years and i'm now on my
01:43 fourth line chemotherapy
01:45 agent um
01:47 and
01:49 yeah it's sort of a bit of a
01:51 ongoing ongoing profession or ongoing
01:55 commitment this chemotherapy now so yeah
01:57 four years in
01:58 still on chemotherapy
02:00 and and then we started meeting um with
02:03 regards to managing my symptoms
02:06 um specifically pain but actually that's
02:08 branched out into other things and
02:09 that's been quite useful um and here we
02:12 are today
02:13 when did we first meet i think it was
02:15 about two years ago
02:17 yeah i think so and it was
02:19 it was specifically for
02:21 the pain in my arm wasn't it at that
02:23 point i think that was the reason we
02:27 we first started meeting yeah
02:29 and actually that's been
02:31 less of a focus more recently and that's
02:33 been that's actually
02:35 not really an issue anymore but it's
02:36 probably because we've
02:38 with your help we've managed it
02:41 and uh again thanks for um agreeing to
02:44 to doing this this video as well as as
02:46 you know we're sort of hoping to
02:48 increase the um the the amount of videos
02:51 we're doing with regard to advanced care
02:53 planning conversations and the talk cpr
02:56 video uh website um as as well so i'm
02:59 really grateful to you for that but um
03:01 yeah so we've known each other for for a
03:03 little while and um i've met your uh
03:06 your your partner as well
03:09 tarek and um
03:10 yeah so i think i've alluded to the fact
03:13 that at some point i'd want to discuss
03:15 maybe about future treatments um
03:19 things that you would consider
03:21 potentially appropriate in your care and
03:23 things where you may have
03:26 thoughts or
03:28 or knowledge gaps potentially or
03:29 whatever in terms of
03:31 addressing them and sort of
03:33 uh
03:34 yeah i mean as you can see sometimes i
03:36 find this i find i find this not an easy
03:38 one to bring up in consultations because
03:40 i think everyone sometimes gets a
03:42 i can get a bit sort of anxious about
03:44 talking about it you know and and and it
03:46 is really sometimes about imagining what
03:48 you might be like or what you might want
03:51 when you far less well and i think
03:52 sometimes as a construct people don't
03:54 always like to think about that so
03:56 no stop me at any point if you want to
03:59 or put the brakes on and we can we can
04:01 discuss something completely different
04:04 it's okay fine that's absolutely fine
04:06 you're happy to go ahead yeah yes of
04:08 course okay fine i mean i sometimes kind
04:10 of approach it in a sort of treatment
04:12 ladder approach if you're sort of going
04:14 up the ladder of intensity of treatments
04:16 for it so
04:18 um
04:19 so for instance you've been admitted in
04:20 the past to hospital with with with
04:23 things like you know maybe
04:25 infections chest infections or for
04:27 chemotherapy or or for other potential
04:29 treatments and
04:31 i am assuming as of this moment that
04:35 that is something you would still very
04:37 much consider so if you would develop a
04:39 pneumonia for instance you'd want to
04:40 come into hospital for intravenous
04:42 treatments um antibiotics etc etc
04:46 yes yeah definitely i think that would
04:47 be appropriate and yeah i would want
04:50 that yeah
04:51 um
04:52 and so
04:53 you know and actually some people say to
04:55 me no that's not something that they
04:56 would necessarily want or where they
04:59 want to reconsideration for instance
05:01 um and you're sort of having um ongoing
05:04 treatment with with chemotherapy
05:07 and etc and so that
05:09 is also something that you're discussing
05:10 with the oncologists and you you're more
05:12 than happy to carry on and continue with
05:15 those as well
05:16 yeah at the moment it's providing me
05:18 um it's it's a very tolerable regime and
05:21 it's providing me a pretty good decent
05:24 quality of life so
05:25 and we're happy to carry on yeah okay
05:29 and then for treatments like
05:31 blood transfusions
05:33 i'm assuming you're okay with those as
05:34 well yeah i'm not happy with those
05:36 should it should
05:38 should you become anemic or something
05:39 like that yeah fine okay
05:42 um
05:43 and then
05:44 yeah i mean
05:45 when we're sort of upscaling a little
05:47 bit in terms of just other potential
05:49 treatments so
05:50 you know if if you were
05:52 in a situation where you became really
05:55 really unwell
05:56 uh and you collapsed for instance
05:59 um
06:01 and
06:02 you know it was kind of an emergency
06:04 situation and such and your partner
06:06 contacted the ambulance crew for
06:08 instance um
06:10 what would you want the approach to be
06:13 as such so let's say for instance that
06:16 um there had been a situation where
06:19 it's such a severe episode of whatever
06:21 has happened for instance a severe
06:23 sepsis or something like that
06:25 um together with all the other
06:27 problems that are occurring that your
06:29 heart and breathing stop
06:31 um
06:32 have you
06:33 you know i mean
06:35 very difficult for anyone to envisage
06:37 what that situation might sort of look
06:39 like and how one would want it handled
06:42 but
06:43 you know given how you are at the moment
06:45 how how would you want that situation
06:47 handled in the future
06:49 so i think
06:51 that what you said was just actually
06:52 probably quite important is given how i
06:54 am at the moment so
06:56 if that were to happen today then i
06:59 think i would
07:01 probably like to be given
07:02 the chance and actually have
07:04 most things done including cpr um
07:07 especially if
07:09 i was well to start with um you know cut
07:12 like as i am now i have good quality of
07:14 life i'm active
07:15 um well in myself
07:17 um and there was potentially a
07:20 reversible cause so you know something
07:22 that we could treat like a pneumonia and
07:24 there was a chance i could get better
07:26 then um i think that would be what i
07:29 would like
07:31 right now but obviously as
07:34 things progress and as my disease
07:35 progresses and as things
07:37 move on and if i'm not as well then i
07:39 think that's definitely something i
07:40 would need to revisit if at any point
07:44 my
07:44 sort of baseline function or my quality
07:47 of life wasn't as good as it is now then
07:49 that might that would probably be
07:50 something i'd have to reconsider yeah
07:53 okay thanks for being very open about
07:55 that and i hope you don't mind my
07:57 frankness about the whole topic as well
07:59 because i mean
08:00 some people can talk about it completely
08:02 openly and other people find it a bit
08:04 more difficult so do time out if you
08:06 don't want to continue talking about it
08:08 okay so that's really useful to know and
08:10 i mean i i suppose it's a situation
08:12 where you're you're 39 and i know you
08:16 you you enjoy the outdoors um growing up
08:18 with the dog etc etc i think you
08:22 you know despite the whole situation
08:23 that you're in i think you you'd
08:25 probably still outrun me
08:28 but okay
08:30 in terms of in terms of your abilities
08:32 and and your sort of fitness levels and
08:34 keeping up to date with things like that
08:36 so
08:37 i suppose uh for me the sort of thoughts
08:39 are if if you if if something sudden
08:42 were to happen uh with you so if you
08:45 came to my outpatient clinic in belinda
08:47 and you suddenly collapsed and it was
08:49 sort of a cardiac arrest situation
08:52 um
08:53 then i i would uh
08:55 get the arrest team and we would
08:57 basically make sure that you
08:59 if there was a shockable rhythm for
09:01 instance we would give you the shocks
09:03 and take you through the sequences of
09:04 cpr how successful will be i do not know
09:07 i cannot tell but this is something that
09:10 you would want considered um if it were
09:12 to happen yeah okay fine and that's
09:14 that's completely fine now this is sort
09:17 of a second situation i suppose which is
09:20 for some even even worse or more
09:22 difficult to to imagine where it's not
09:25 about this sudden cardiac risk where
09:27 something happens but it's more about a
09:29 sort of slower
09:31 i mean some people call it natural dying
09:33 which i don't know you know what is
09:36 natural dying but uh
09:38 but but some people people call this
09:39 sort of
09:40 you know that the body gets weaker over
09:42 time
09:44 and the cancer grows unfortunately
09:46 bigger and
09:47 people become more more prone to having
09:49 infections and pneumonias and
09:51 they may be admitted four or five times
09:54 a year with the pneumonia and then the
09:55 last pneumonia is just too difficult to
09:57 treat and and then they gradually fade
09:58 away
09:59 yeah and and this sometimes over happens
10:02 over sort of four five six days or so
10:04 where people get more sleepy over time
10:06 and sometimes need a bit of symptom
10:08 support
10:10 i mean in in natural dying situations
10:12 giving cpr has a zero percent success
10:15 rate
10:16 you know so it really is you could shock
10:19 that heart uh till tomorrow and and it
10:22 wouldn't start again it's not like
10:23 cardiac arrest it's very different
10:26 um
10:27 and so in in those situations
10:29 just having your views on on on how one
10:31 handles the situation i suppose i can
10:34 tell you as a clinician it wouldn't work
10:36 and i wouldn't do that to your body you
10:37 know i i would see that in a way as an
10:39 assault but we would do everything to
10:41 make sure
10:42 that you're as comfortable
10:43 as possible
10:45 yeah
10:46 um
10:46 but just to explore your views on that
10:48 whether where you stand
10:50 yeah i completely agree i mean if it
10:52 gets to the point where my body is just
10:55 too weak and too frail
10:57 to carry on or it's it is in its natural
11:00 dying process whatever we're calling
11:02 that and then yeah 100
11:04 that would seem futile and
11:07 um
11:07 almost undignified to be doing things
11:10 like cpr if it's going to be completely
11:12 fruitless and actually um there is
11:14 something to be said i think for a a
11:16 good good death you know where you're
11:19 you're peaceful and your symptoms are
11:20 managed and
11:22 it's it's not sort of tubes and
11:23 everything coming out of you until your
11:26 last
11:26 last moment so yeah i know i completely
11:28 agree with you on that as well
11:31 so i suppose we're sort of in a in a
11:32 stage where we're sort of openly
11:34 discussing these things and having these
11:35 conversations about these these topics
11:37 about these two different scenarios
11:39 and i wouldn't be writing a dna cpr form
11:43 now i mean i suppose i could nearly
11:45 write one now stating what we've just
11:46 said the different scenarios so
11:49 and only it would only apply then in a
11:51 natural dying scenario as such but i'm
11:54 probably not going to do that because i
11:55 think that would confuse matters in some
11:57 some ways but
11:59 at some point if if you were very poorly
12:01 or very frail
12:03 in hospital or
12:04 in in hospice setting or at home for
12:07 instance i think i think that might
12:09 become become necessary and i think it's
12:11 just something that
12:13 i like to sort of discuss at an earlier
12:15 time point
12:16 um
12:18 i mean how do you think your
12:20 your partner would would take this i
12:22 mean this is that something that he's
12:24 prepared for the discussions that you've
12:26 held before about talking about
12:28 the end i suppose yeah i think he would
12:31 he would in principle agree with
12:33 everything we said undoubtedly would be
12:35 um
12:36 excuse me it would be difficult
12:38 conversation and he would find it we he
12:40 would find it difficult um but i think
12:43 completely in agreement with me probably
12:46 and we both feel the same in that
12:49 um
12:51 if it's it's it's hard it's difficult
12:54 well we wouldn't want anything to
12:55 interfere with a natural dying process
12:58 if it's if it's that near the end um and
13:00 for it to be as it's
13:02 as peaceful and peaceful um and
13:05 as possible so that we can spend as much
13:06 time together as possible yeah yeah okay
13:10 okay that's a useful conversation tab
13:12 and i suppose if you could discuss it
13:14 with him that would that would be great
13:16 um
13:17 equally next time i see you maybe face
13:20 to face in our clinic you can you can
13:22 always bring him along if you want to
13:23 and we can have a few follow-on
13:25 conversations from from that one
13:27 um
13:28 equally you know i don't want to over
13:30 discuss the topic because i think
13:31 sometimes you know
13:33 healthcare professionals might like
13:35 myself can can be a bit sort of over
13:37 focused on
13:38 on this one big area and i suppose you
13:40 know i like to talk about all the
13:41 treatments you'd find acceptable uh yes
13:43 or no basically and just get explore
13:46 your views on it but maybe
13:48 i'll i'll note i'll note some of those
13:49 down but and then i don't want to make
13:51 it the topic of discussion every single
13:53 time you know sure
13:55 yeah
13:57 okay any uh questions or any follow-up
13:60 queries on on that one
14:02 no um no except to say that i remember
14:05 when we first brought this up um i did
14:08 actually find it
14:09 quite a relief that you brought it up um
14:12 because you know when we're having
14:14 treatment in the cancer world
14:17 everyone's so it's not in most people's
14:19 minds you know patients especially but
14:21 it's not something that gets brought up
14:23 a lot necessarily um and we're all
14:25 thinking it uh you know our families are
14:27 thinking it so it is it was quite a
14:29 relief for me and it was a yeah it was
14:32 it was a welcome
14:34 topic so thank you for bringing it up oh
14:36 really oh wow and and that sounds like a
14:39 little bit like it's a bit of an
14:40 elephant in the room and yeah absolutely
14:43 yeah
14:44 and actually having someone like you to
14:48 dispel the myths or just clarify a few
14:50 issues probably is quite helpful for a
14:52 lot of people um especially because it's
14:55 not something that we know much about
14:57 necessarily um
14:59 at this point in our journeys as it were
15:02 yeah
15:04 thank you cat thanks for this and i'm
15:06 going to stop the recording now but
15:08 thank you so much for that
15:10 thank you
