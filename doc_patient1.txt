01:05 look at what's causing your headache um
01:07 I will go over history physical and then
01:10 um we'll do again a physical exam and
01:12 then we will look into your insurance
01:14 policy and make sure that's all okay you
01:16 know taking care of that sound like a
01:17 good plan for you that's that's good
01:19 perfect um so tell me a little bit more
01:22 about this the head head pain that
01:24 you're having well um it started about 3
01:27 days ago and um uh uh nothing has helped
01:32 it it's it's just laid me flat I um
01:35 haven't been able to go to work um it's
01:39 um nothing's helped I I um it's it's all
01:44 over um I it really bad when I move so
01:48 I'm trying not to move too much and the
01:51 light is bothering me a lot okay um and
01:53 unfortunately I can't dim the lights in
01:56 this room but so I'll try to go quickly
01:58 and um would it be okay if I took some
02:00 notes oh sure all right so you said this
02:03 headache started about 3 days ago okay
02:07 um was there any um anything that
02:10 brought it on anything unusual that
02:11 happened maybe three days ago not really
02:13 no okay um can you tell me uh anything
02:17 that makes it better is oh nothing's
02:20 made it better I I took some Tylenol I
02:23 tried Motrin nothing um I just try not
02:26 to move too much all right um is there
02:29 anything that makes it worse yeah like
02:31 movement um and and light okay and um
02:36 it's just constant though there's you
02:38 know it doesn't it's just constant it's
02:40 it's all over okay um so if you had to
02:44 rate on a Pain Scale um zero being no
02:47 pain 10 being the worst pain you ever
02:49 had oh it's a 10 a 10 I've never had a
02:52 headache like this okay yeah that sounds
02:54 really bad um now as far as radiation
02:57 does it move does that you said the head
02:59 the pain is all up it's kind of all over
03:02 um but it also I've got this shooting
03:06 pain down my neck and my neck is is very
03:09 stiff okay um but it's not it's it's
03:13 it's the entire head entire head okay
03:16 yeah
03:18 um as far as in the in the timing you
03:21 said that started three days ago but is
03:23 it you said is a constant yeah it it it
03:28 started gradually but once once it got
03:31 there it's hasn't gone away it doesn't
03:35 get better it doesn't get worse it's
03:37 just the same okay um so do
03:42 you what I want to get is your
03:44 perception of what you think is going on
03:46 I don't know I just I can hardly think
03:49 it's so painful I I just um because it's
03:53 so bad I was afraid um my neighbor um
03:58 had a headache and ignored it last year
04:01 and uh he suddenly started having
04:03 seizures and it turns out he had a um a
04:07 brain tumor so I thought I I just should

04:12 concern
04:14 um what how is it impacting your daily
04:17 life I can't go to work um uh I can't do

07:06 okay um nothing out of the ordinary over
07:09 the past couple weeks have you been on
07:10 any trips or
07:12 anything or actually a week ago I was in
07:16 um North Carolina for a family reunion
07:19 okay and there was a four-year-old who
07:21 was sick there I I don't know what they
07:23 had but they I guess I guess they ended
07:25 up taking them into
07:27 emergency know
07:30 um so let me just so summarize to make
07:32 sure I've got everything straight so far
07:34 is um you started an onset of a severe
07:37 headache about 3 days ago um it's worse
07:39 with movement light really makes it hurt
07:42 bad um it's a 10 out of 10 pain and
07:44 you're also complaining of a stiff neck
07:46 with that yes um it came on gradually
07:49 and it's been constant pain in the
07:51 frontal area um medical history you're
07:54 in hyper you have high blood pressure
07:56 but that's um controlled with diet uh no
07:58 surgical history no ear
08:00 hospitalizations um the pain though is
08:03 really impacting your day-to-day living
08:05 and daily life um you to tried Tylenol
08:09 mult it didn't help otherwise no
08:11 medications um you've got the family
08:13 history of your mom with migraines
08:14 otherwise you're um family is healthy
08:18 yeah U you smoke about a half a pack a
08:20 day you don't drink um and then you were
08:24 you you said you took a trip about a
08:26 week ago or two weeks ago yeah okay
08:30 a week ago yeah I don't know it was in
08:33 North Carolina all right um yeah I can
08:38 understand your concern you about your
08:39 friend you said that was having
08:43 seizures um I've just never had this
08:46 kind of pain before yeah and I can
08:49 understand that and you know um so what
08:51 I would like to do is
08:54 um we've pretty much gone over your the
08:57 history what I'd like to do is uh
08:59 complete a physical exam okay um do some
09:02 testing all right um and I want to ask
09:04 too if there's any other concerns I need
09:06 to address um before we get to that
09:07 final exam okay that that sounds good
09:10 okay sounds great
09:14 okay all right hi I'm Deb I'm your
09:19 standardized
09:20 patient nice job um I'm going to uh give
09:25 you some feedback on your communication
09:27 skills uh in this encounter but before I
09:29 do how did you feel it went um I pretty
09:33 good I was I was nervous at first I
09:34 think and um just trying to make sure
09:37 that um I was getting all your patient
09:39 information so we could you know make
09:41 sure we got the correct tests and yeah
09:44 you know yeah how did you feel when when
09:46 you walked in you feel pretty
09:47 comfortable uh I think I got more
09:50 comfortable as we sat down and got to
09:52 talk I could see that yeah good okay um
09:56 well I thought you did a a nice job uh
09:59 you had an appr introduction uh
10:01 introduced yourself for some last name
10:03 shook hands um I think you have a very
10:06 warm demeanor and you're comfortable uh
10:09 which uh makes me as a patient
10:12 comfortable you did um ex uh elicit my
10:16 chief complaint and asked about any
10:18 other concerns and that's when I told
10:19 you I was also concerned about my
10:21 insurance so that was another thing on
10:24 the agenda so you did set a mutual
10:26 agenda asked me if I agreed and so we
10:29 had a clear road map going forward so
10:31 you did um you hit all those real well
10:34 you your first question tell me about
10:36 this pain or um that was a nice
10:38 open-ended question so allowed me to
10:41 then tell my story um followed up with
10:45 some more um pointed questions just for
10:49 clarification on um and you had you're
10:53 an active listener had good contact eye
10:55 contact and um could do a little bit
10:59 more
11:00 um uh reflective listening um just to
11:04 little points where you could verify um
11:07 check for accuracy maybe paraphrase as
11:10 as I'm going through through um you did
11:13 a nice summary uh in the middle that's
11:15 good but just a little bit more
11:17 reflection on that to let me know as a
11:19 patient that you're hearing me um you
11:22 asked my perspective of what I thought
11:24 was going on and then you got the story
11:26 um of M fear that maybe I've got a brain
11:29 tumor oh no yeah so um I thought you had
11:33 nice flow logical U uh sequence of
11:38 questioning um little bit of sign
11:41 posting We just covered this and now
11:43 we're going to do that I I heard that
11:45 once um and as these um interviews get
11:49 longer you're going to want to signpost
11:51 between each um section I've taken your
11:55 history now I'd like to go into um a a
11:59 physical exam kind of thing um did a
12:02 nice summary in the middle uh you move
12:04 through quickly so you attended to um
12:07 the timeline you did ask permission
12:10 permission to ask some um uh social
12:14 questions maybe you want to mention um
12:17 social questions may not be a flag for
12:19 me that this is this could be personal
12:21 or uncomfortable maybe I'm going to ask
12:24 a little more some personal questions
12:26 here is that all right with you just so
12:28 I'm social question sounds fine to me
12:31 until you start asking something that
12:32 might sound personal so you might use
12:34 the word some more personal perfect
12:38 questions here uh not non-judgmental
12:40 didn't you know didn't bad an I when
12:42 when I said I smoke half a pack um you
12:46 have nice uh vocal range eye contact UM
12:50 comfortable demeanor so uh that um felt
12:54 real good and then um you uh did a
12:59 summary
12:60 uh at the end and um asked did you ask
13:04 do anything else okay so anything else
13:08 before um we do a physical exam so it
13:11 was very nice nice encounter well thank
13:13 you so much uh nice meeting you you to
