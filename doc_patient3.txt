14:35 what we need to do now is to check some
14:38 Vital Signs and I need to examine you
14:40 before we could decide you know what's
14:42 going on with your sore throat and cough
14:44 and take it from there is that okay with
14:46 you that's fine good thank
14:50 you well that concludes our
14:52 demonstration of the history taking
14:53 process Paul is a senior lecturer at the
14:56 University and has kindly offered to
14:58 give feedback from a patient perspective
15:01 the key principles used in the history
15:03 taking process was first and foremost me
15:06 as the practitioner ensuring that the
15:08 environment was safe and accessible for
15:11 the patient I was also mindful to avoid
15:14 interruptions thus maintaining the
15:16 patient's privacy and
15:19 confidentiality as I called a patient in
15:22 I was mindful not to use the patient's
15:24 first name but to seek permission so how
15:27 did you feel about that pool I I thought
15:30 that was uh quite appropriate and I felt
15:32 that you you respected my uh right to be
15:34 called Mr Mr Collins or Paul accordingly
15:38 um and I was happy to be called Paul
15:41 great I also felt it was imperative that
15:44 I gained informed consent and so I told
15:47 the patient at the outset what was to be
15:50 expected and seek consent from him I
15:53 also thought that it was important that
15:55 I used an open-ended question at the
15:58 outset so that the patient could tell
15:60 his story in his own words how did you
16:03 find that um I I thought that was good
16:06 uh and I certainly had the opportunity
16:07 to talk about what was concerning me
16:09 which was obviously the cough um so yeah
16:13 I got that out of the way quite quickly
16:14 I think great all good the other thing
16:17 is although I'm wanting the patient to
16:19 tell their own story I also am mindful
16:22 of the red flags thus ruling out
16:25 life-threatening causes I Tred to be
16:28 systematic but I also also wanted to
16:30 respond to the patient cues as well and
16:33 so whenever the
16:36 patient gave a leading answer I would
16:39 allow him the scope to explore that
16:42 further I then went through the key
16:44 processes of History taking and then
16:47 allowed at the very end to sum up thus
16:50 allowing the patient to clarify it from
16:52 their perspective I was mindful as well
16:55 not to use jargons but how did you feel
16:59 I cuz sometimes we get lost as
17:01 practitioners and we we see medical
17:04 jargons as normal terminology I think on
17:06 on the whole it was very good um and for
17:09 the most part it was fairly free of
17:11 medical jargon although I know at one
17:13 point you did ask about social history
17:16 which which I think had the potential to
17:19 confuse somebody of course I didn't
17:21 think of it that that but that's so
17:23 right
17:25 absolutely great I mean the questions
17:27 once you once you'd said you were going
17:28 to ask about the social history I think
17:29 the questions were absolutely fine it's
17:32 just that just that headlining really of
17:34 that particular area of the history
17:36 taking up perhaps that's and that's
17:38 important for me to note as a
17:40 practitioner well that concludes the key
17:42 steps in history taking process and we
17:44 hope that we've helped you to add
17:46 structure and depth to your history
17:48 taking in the clinical
17:51 setting and I will put some referencing
17:55 online for you that will help you to
17:57 explore further the KE key issues
17:59 surrounding history taking thank you
18:02 very
18:28 much e
